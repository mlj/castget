.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBcastget\fR downloads RSS enclosures, for example podcasts, from RSS feeds\.
.
.P
RSS feeds are assigned \fIchannel identifier\fRs in the configuration file \fB\.castgetrc\fR\. Channels to be processed by \fBcastget\fR are indicated by supplying the channel identifiers as arguments\. If no channel identifiers are provided, all available channels are processed\.
