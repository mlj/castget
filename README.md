### Building from source

| Branch | Linux (clang) | Linux (gcc) | macOS |
|--------|---------------|-------------|-------|
|master|[![Linux (clang) Build Status](https://travis-matrix-badges.herokuapp.com/repos/mlj/castget/branches/master/2)](https://travis-ci.org/mlj/castget)|[![Linux (gcc) Build Status](https://travis-matrix-badges.herokuapp.com/repos/mlj/castget/branches/master/3)](https://travis-ci.org/mlj/castget)|[![macOS Build Status](https://travis-matrix-badges.herokuapp.com/repos/mlj/castget/branches/master/1)](https://travis-ci.org/mlj/castget)|

To build from a distribution tarball, do the following:

```shell
./configure
make
make install
```

To disable taglib support, pass `--without-taglib` to `configure`;

```shell
./configure --without-taglib
```

### Building from git

```shell
git clone https://github.com/mlj/castget.git
```

then rebuild the autoconf scripts

```shell
autoreconf -fi
./configure
make
make install
```

You will also need [ronn](http://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/), which is used to
build the man pages. Prebuilt man pages are included in the distribution.

### Building from Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is available in contrib folder.

Build docker image. 

```

```

Create a file `.castgetrc` as shown on [Usage](Usage) and run container.

```
docker run -v $(pwd):/castget --rm -it castget
```

## Usage
